# Pratyum Jagannath Resume Template


Built on top of AltaCV. 


## Samples

This is how the re-created résumé looks like ([view/open on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/pbxsxmxtjxgc)):


## Requirements and Compilation

* AltaCV uses [`fontawesome`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome) and [`academicons`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/academicons); they're included in both TeX Live 2016 and MikTeX 2.9.
* The samples here use the [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) font.
* LuaLaTeX compilation is **strongly** recommended. If you want to use XeLaTeX instead, that's fine, but you may need to make sure `academicons.ttf` is installed _on_ your operating system, not just available in your `TEXMF` tree with the `academicons` LaTeX package.
